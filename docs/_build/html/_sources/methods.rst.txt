Methods
=======
This project uses Deep Artificial Neural Networks, with most of the network architectures that were experimented with belonging to the class of networks called Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). The types of architectures tried and possible to train and test with the current scripts are: simple Perceptron, vanilla RNN, LSTM, GRU and Transformer (encoder blocks only). The networks can be made bi-directional and dropout can be added.

For more information about these see the report.
